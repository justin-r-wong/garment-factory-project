#### Submitting Good Bug Reports
This section guides you through how to contribute as a direct or external partner. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report 📝, reproduce the behavior 💻 💻, and find related reports 🔎. Create an issue [here](https://github.com/jw327/dsci-310-group-01/issues).

- We recommend that you create a Git branch for each pull request (PR).
- Provide as much detail as possible, starting from the very beginning of how the repo was cloned and the following steps you took to help us recreate the bug you faced
- Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples.
- Provide the specifications of your environment the bug was found in
-  Include screenshots and animated GIFs which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem. 

If you are contributing directly:
- Use issues for listing tasks that need accomplishment, and assignment of tasks.
- Issues should be linked to project milestones.
- A Project board is used to organize the issues.
- Pull at the beginning of each work session, and push at the end.

These guidelines were adapted from [Atom's contrbuting guidleines](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) and UBC-DSCI's [provided example](https://github.com/UBC-DSCI/predict-airbnb-nightly-price/blob/v1.0.2/CONTRIBUTING.md)
