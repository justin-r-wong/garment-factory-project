## Summary

The trillion-dollar garment industry is largely fueled by the production and performance of employees that work in manufacturing companies as a labor-intensive, low-skilled industry. As the industry is driven by ever-changing consumer demands and fashion trends, the need for manual processes is inevitable.

Through statistical inference, we seek to dig deeper into the relationship between important attributes of the garment manufacturing process and its employees‚Äô productivity in the following question: **What factors affect the productivity of a garment factory?**

To answer this question, we performed data analysis to search for the most optimized model. Using forward selection and LASSO, we compare different models and determine which factors are the best in explaining relationships between the factors and the actual productivity of the garment factory. Both of the models produced a fairly poor adjusted ùëÖ<sup>2</sup> values of 0.17 and 0.169 when testing the model with the testing data. Additionally, neither of the selected models were significantly better than the full model according to the corresponding F-tests. Lastly, we discuss the implications of our results, the limitations of the project, and propose future questions that can be asked based on our project.

## Running the Analysis
### Using Docker
1. Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
2. Clone the repository
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/DSCI-310/dsci-310-group-01.git
   ```
3. Use the terminal/command line to navigate to the root directory of the project
   ```
   cd dsci-310-group-01
   ```
4. Obtain the Docker Image from Dockerhub
   - Use the terminal/command line to pull the image
   ```
   docker pull jwong086/dsci-310-group-01:latest 
   ```
   - Use the terminal/command line to find the IMAGE ID
   ```
   docker images jwong086/dsci-310-group-01 
   ```
   - Copy the IMAGE ID in the third column and use the terminal/command the tag the image
   ```
   docker tag <IMAGE ID> dsci-310-group-01-env
   ```
5. Run the following to set up the environment:
   ```
   docker run --rm -p 8787:8787 -e PASSWORD=x  -v /$(pwd):/home/rstudio/project dsci-310-group-01-env
   ```
6. In a browser navigate to `localhost:8787`
7. Use the following credentials to sign in:
   - USERNAME = `rstudio`
   - PASSWORD = `x`
8. Access the analysis
  - Navigate to the `/project` folder using: 
   ```
   cd project
   ```
   - In the Rstudio terminal run the following to produce the html report:
   ```
   make report
   ```
   - To reset the repo to a clean state use:
   ```
   make clean
   ```
   - To obtain the files needed to `make report` from clean slate use:
   ```
   make all
   ```
